hailstone sequence is a sequence of numbers generated by recursively applying
the function 'f' on 'n' defined as
    f(n) = { n/2; if n is even | 3n + 1; if n is odd }


'hailstone-sequence' program prints the longest hailstone sequence for an
integer N provided through command-line as '-l N' or '--longest N'
